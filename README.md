# Selenium Automation for Trello  

This repository contains automated test scripts for verifying key functionalities of the [Trello](https://trello.com/) web application. The project is implemented using Selenium in Python, and all tests are designed to validate both functional and non-functional requirements.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Selenium**  
Selenium is an open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It enables scripting interactions with web elements, mimicking user actions to test and automate web applications effectively.

### **Key Objectives**
- Validate the login functionality for valid and invalid credentials.  
- Test the creation and management of boards, lists, and cards.  
- Verify drag-and-drop functionality for cards between lists.  
- Check the display and availability of key elements on the dashboard.  
- Test filtering, labeling, and search functionalities.

---

## **Test Scenarios**

1. **Login Functionality**  
   - Valid credentials: Ensures successful login.  
   - Invalid credentials: Validates proper error handling.

2. **Board, List, and Card Management**  
   - Automates the creation of boards, lists, and cards post-login.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**  
   - Automates moving cards between lists.

4. **Dashboard Elements Validation**  
   - Verifies that specific UI elements (e.g., buttons, search bar) are displayed correctly.

5. **Filtering, Labeling, and Search Features**  
   - Automates filtering with labels, adding custom labels to cards, and searching for boards or cards.

## **Project Setup**

### **Software Used**
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Browser:** Google Chrome  
- **Testing Libraries:**  
  - `pytest`  
  - `pytest-cov`  
  - `pytest-html`  
  - `pytest-metadata`  
  - `pytest-dotenv`  
  - `webdriver-manager`

## **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raghav-narayan/selenium.git
   cd selenium
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the test scripts using pytest:  
   ```bash
   pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
   ```

4. View the test report:  
   - Open `report.html` in your browser.

---

## **Test Execution Summary**

### **Execution Environment**  
- **Browser:** Chrome  
- **Test Runner:** pytest  

### **Report**  
- Test coverage reports are auto-generated using `pytest-cov` and stored in the `coverage/` folder.  
- HTML reports (`report.html`) summarize the execution status of all test cases.  
- Screenshots taken during each test step are available in the `screenshots/` folder.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**  
   - Functional and non-functional requirements are thoroughly validated.

2. **HTML Test Reports**  
   - Consolidated reports generated with pytest provide detailed insights into the test cases.

3. **Screenshots**  
   - Each major step in the test execution is captured for reference.

## **Test Case Highlights**

### **Login Functionality**
- Valid Login:
  - Email: `rxr0654@mavs.uta.edu`
  - Password: `*******`
  - Expected Outcome: Login successful.  
- Invalid Login:
  - Various test cases for invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect email/password combinations).

### **Board and List Management**  
- Example Test Data:  
  - Board Title: `Test Board`  
  - List Name: `To Do`  

### **Drag-and-Drop**
- Scenario: Move the card “Design and Development” from the "To Do" list to the "In Progress" list.
